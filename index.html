      <h3>About me!</h3>
      <p>
        After college, I worked as a payroll clerk for my brother-in-law's concrete business. Although accounting and payroll are reliable fields of work, I wanted to do something more creative. 
        I found that I enjoy marketing and creating an online presence for his business more than the office work. 
      </p>

        Looking for more ways to improve our outreach, I stumbled upon Thinkful's Software Engineering program. It fit exactly what I was looking for. 
        I started my Software Engineering journey with Thinkful in March of 2023 and I couldn't be happier!

        Outside of web and software development I am also interested in 3D Printing and computer building. I enjoy being creative and designing prints that assist with everyday life!
